# Project Flow

1. **Repository Cloning**: 
    - Clone the MERN stack repository for movie CRUD operations.

2. **Docker Setup**:
    - Develop Dockerfiles for the frontend and server components.

3. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
    - Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file orchestrating three containers: frontend, backend, and MongoDB database.

4. **Image Repository**:
    - Push Docker images to Docker Hub for accessibility.

5. **Kubernetes Setup**:
    - Install Minikube to facilitate creation of Kubernetes clusters.

6. **ArgoCD Installation and Configuration**:
    - Install and configure ArgoCD for continuous deployment.

7. **Namespace Creation**:
    - Create a namespace for ArgoCD operations.

8. **ArgoCD Application Creation**:
    - Utilize the ArgoCD UI to create a new application, linking it to the GitHub repository.

9. **Deployment File Generation**:
    - Use Kompose to convert the `docker-compose.yaml` file into individual `deployment.yaml` files for Kubernetes.

10. **Deployment and Validation**:
    - Push deployment files to GitHub and ensure successful deployment through ArgoCD.

11. **Rollout Configuration**:
    - Modify deployment files to incorporate canary deployment strategies, adjusting traffic weights for controlled rollout.

12. **Continuous Integration**:
    - Implement GitHub integration with ArgoCD for automatic deployment upon code changes.

# Problem Solving

1. **Deployment File Issues**:
    - Faced health status errors initially due to manual deployment file creation. Resolved by using Kompose for automated conversion.

2. **Rollout Errors**:
    - Encounter deployment errors during rollout configurations. Overcome by adjusting configuration files as per requirements.

3. **MongoDB Volume Creation**:
    - Struggle initially with MongoDB volume creation. Resolve by realizing the necessity of creating volumes within the container using services.

4. **Miscellaneous Issues**:
    - Address other challenges with the aid of resources like Stack Overflow and ChatGPT, ensuring smooth project progression.

# Conclusion
Through meticulous setup, configuration, and problem-solving, the project successfully implements  Argo CD for continuous deployment and Argo Rollouts for advanced deployment strategies within a Kubernetes environment.
